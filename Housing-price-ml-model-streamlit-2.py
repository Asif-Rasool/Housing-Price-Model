### 🧾 Odd Patterns & Outliers  
**Data distributions which slightly stick out:**

- On first impression, a few outlier groups are present in our data — possibly due to the way in which the data was sampled (e.g., `housing_median_age` & `median_house_value`).
- `housing_median_age` shows some discontinuity and a sharp peak at its maximum value. This becomes more apparent when adjusting histogram bins.
- `median_house_value` has an unusual spike at the upper limit (around $500K), likely due to data clipping or capping.

**Less Noticeable Outliers:**

- Several features show **skewed** distributions — around 6 of them — which is concerning since we're using a relatively simple model.
- Some features, like `population`, have a broad range on the x-axis, suggesting many outliers.
- Features such as `population`, `total_bedrooms`, and `total_rooms`, which are related, also share a similar skew toward smaller values.

These characteristics should be kept in mind for potential transformation or scaling before modeling.

    ### 🧮 Bivariate Correlation Matrix

Bivariate analysis involves examining the relationship between **two variables** at a time.  
A **correlation matrix** is a fast and effective way to gain insight into potential feature relationships in the dataset.

💡 **Key Points to Consider:**

- The matrix only captures **linear relationships** between features.
- It's useful for identifying **redundant features** — those that are too highly or too lowly correlated.
- Strong correlations may indicate that some features are essentially measuring the same thing.
- Weak correlations across the board might suggest **nonlinear** relationships or more complex interactions.

We use this matrix to understand which features are worth keeping, transforming, or dropping before modeling.

### 📌 Interpretation: Target Variable Relationships

- The target variable `median_house_value` is **very mildly correlated** with all features except one — **`median_income`**, which stands out as an important predictor.
- Features like `population` and `longitude` show very weak negative correlations (-0.02 and -0.05 respectively). While these may appear uninformative, **low correlation alone isn't a reason to drop a feature**.
- Such low values may indicate a **nonlinear relationship**, which can still carry predictive power — just not in a linear sense.
- That said, for **simpler models** (e.g., linear regressors), it's often advised to drop these weakly correlated features, as they’re less likely to contribute meaningfully and might introduce noise.

Bivariate scatter plots (or pairplots) are **very insightful** for exploring relationships between two variables.  
They help reveal patterns, clusters, correlations, and potential outliers.

💡 **What to look for in scatter plots:**

- **Irregular two-feature patterns** or outliers — combining features reveals more than univariate views.
- **Two-dimensional clusters** in the data (can be emphasized using KDE density contours).
- **Visual signs of correlation** — is there a clear linear trend, or is the data spread randomly?

While we can use color labeling in scatter matrices, it often becomes hard to distinguish in crowded plots.

### 🧾 Relating to `median_house_value`

- The relationship between `median_house_value` and `median_income` appears **quite linear**, with some spread perpendicular to the line.  
  Notably, there's a **visible upper limit** for all values of `median_income` — a capped value that visually stands out.

- The relationship between `median_house_age` and `median_house_value` looks **highly scattered** with no obvious pattern.  
  The KDE plot reveals **two peaks roughly 20 years apart**, possibly indicating changes in affordability or housing policy.

- There's also a visible cluster near the **maximum values** for both features — again, highly nonlinear and broadly spread across the plot.

- The features `total_rooms` and `population` in relation to `median_house_value` show **complex, nonlinear structures**.  
  KDE shows heavy concentration at **low values**, with sparse but notable spread toward higher values — possibly **outliers**.

- Finally, many features differ significantly in **axis scale**.  
  Larger values might be mistakenly interpreted as more important by some models, so **feature scaling should definitely be considered**.

### 🧾 Interpretation

- For our target variable `median_house_value`, the influence of **geography** is immediately visible — values generally increase as we get closer to two main urban clusters.
- `median_income` shows a **strong spatial correlation** with `median_house_value`, especially in coastal areas.
- `housing_median_age` correlates well in some coastal regions but not as clearly inland, suggesting a **nonlinear relationship**.
- `population` is trickier — the data is skewed toward low values, and a few **extreme outliers** distort the pattern. This also aligns with what we observed in histograms and pairplots.
- These plots confirm that **location matters**, and combining features with spatial awareness can significantly improve model performance.
